## Inherited

![](figures/tubulopathies_inherited.png)
Other disorders not depicted here (and not necessarily classified as a pure "tubulopathy'): 

- ADTKD (e.g. HNF1b etc.)  
- FHH (CaSR)  
- ciliopathies (ADPKD etc.)  
- metabolic disorders (oxalosis etc.)  
- endocrine disorders (GRA etc.)

### Notes on some of the inherited tubulopathies

FHHNC = familial hypomagnesaemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis

Inherited pRTA is very rare; inherited dRTA less so.  
Commonest cause of inherited Fanconi syndrome is cystinosis.  
XLD hypophosphataemic rickets is the commonest type; causes elevated FGF23 (phosphatonin).  

X-linked hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis = Dent’s disease, XLR nephrolithiasis, XLR hypophosphataemia rickets, LMWH proteinuria (all CLCn5 mutations).  Encodes chloride channel involved in endosomal acidification – therefore impaired endocytosis by megalin / cubulin.  Defective endocytosis of vitD and PTH lead to calciuria.

## Acquired

![](figures/tubulopathies_acquired.png)


Autoimmune associations with dRTA other than Sjogren are: SLE, PBC, AIH, thyroiditis.  

Can get dRTA mimic secondary to low UNa (e.g. cirrhosis, heart failure, nephrotic syndrome).  For complete list of 2ry causes see supplemental table 1 in [ESPN clinical practice points, NDT 2021](https://doi: 10.1093/ndt/gfab171).

## Tubulopathy syndromes

![](figures/tubulopathies_syndromes.png)
Other tubulopathy phenotypes:

- NDI and SIAD
- nephrocalcinosis
- recurrent stone-formers
- CKD

<br>
<br>

### Interpretation of these electrolyte syndromes

Only causes of hyperchloraemic acidosis:  

- diarrhoea / other lower GI losses (upH < 5.5)  
- RTA  
- ureteric diversion  

<br>

Fanconi = glucose, urate, phosphate, aa, LWMP (uPCR > 50 without uACR or RBP), vitD deficiency

Suspect incomplete dRTA if recurrent stones, nephrocalcinosis and borderline low or low-normal TCO2.  

NB can get a transient Fanconi-type syndrome (without glycosuria) in untreated dRTA.  

<br>
<br>

### Notes on mechanisms (see [ESPN clinical practice points, NDT 2021](https://doi: 10.1093/ndt/gfab171)):  

Mechanism of **hypoK in dRTA**:  

i) response to systemic acidosis (inhibits PCT Na reabsorption and therefore stimulates RAAS)  
ii) increased voltage gradient in CD (Na reabsorption not balanced by H excretion)  
iii) sometimes also drug-induced direct causes (e.g. amphoterocin)  

<br>
<br>

Mechanism of **hypoK in pRTA**:  

i) increased HCO3 delivery and flow rate in distal nephron (Unwin 2001)

<br>
<br>

Mechanism of **hypercalciuria in dRTA**:

i) release of Ca from bone (as protons are buffered by apatite)  
ii) tubular resistance to the anti-calicuric effects of PTH  

<br>
<br>

Mechanisms of **stones / nephrocalcinosis in dRTA**:  

i) hypercalciuria  
ii) hypocituria (enhanced reabsorption of citrate in PCT; citrate inhibits stone formation)

<br>
<br>

## Diagnostic approach in suspected tubulopathy

![](figures/tubulopathies_approach.png)

Exogenous toxins = heavy metals, AA (i.e. herbal preps)
Endogenous toxins = paraproteins

<br>
<br>

### Fractional excretions

- FECl <0.5% = not a salt-losing tubulopathy (and therefore purging instead) 
- FEMg >2 – 4% = renal wasting 
- FEPO4 >10 – 20% = renal wasting 

<br>
<br>

### Urine pH

Urine pH useful but potential for error:  

- upH > 5.5 (uAG +ve) = dRTA 
- upH < 5.5 (uAG -ve) = pRTA or diarrhoea 

<br>

Cautions with upH (see supplement for [ESPN clinical practice points, NDT 2021](https://doi: 10.1093/ndt/gfab171)):  
- artificial high upH if delayed testing (CO2 diffuses out of urine to drop both urinary H+ and HCO3)  
- artificial high upH if urea-splitting organisms (generating NH3)  
- invalid if uNa < 10 mM (acidification is Na-dep)

A [nice study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22700881/) showed that actually the risk of diagnostic error in dRTA from CO2 diffusion is probably quite low.  Tested effect of mixing urine samples with air (n = 100).  Exposure to air reduces urine pCO2 and HCO3 by 66 -- 75%.  CO2 diffusion out of urine samples occurs in first 5 minutes, with no subsequent change out to 50 mins.  This does tend to raise pH - but effect is only small (c. 0.1 pH unit) and particularly so if urine pH < 5.5 to begin with.  

<br>

Concordance between urine dipstick and pH meter result is [not brilliant but not terrible](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23435644/).  So perhaps more important to use pH meter rather than a dip.  

<br>
<br>

### Specialised testing

Rarely a role for more specialist testing:  

- urinary acidification test for recurrent stone-formers / nephrocalcinosis (NOT for frank acidosis) 
- thiazide test for Gitelman or Gordon (FECl) 
- urinary drug screen
- exome testing (available in Scotland for Bartter & Gitelman, Cystinuria, Nephrocalcinosis & Nephrolithiasis (large panel), PHA1 (paeds), tubulopathies and RTA panel (very large panel)

## Management

<!-- 

### Supplements

- NEED TO DO: quantity of all supplements - uptodate?

- Slow K = KCl = start 2 tabs bd = less disgusting than SandoK  
- SlowNa = start 3 tabs tds and titrate up to 10 tabs tds = half daily losses in Gitelman  
- UroCitK = Kcitrate = start 2 tabs bd = crystals on wax tablet (appear in stool)  
- SMC approval for Sibnayal (K citrate + KHCO3 prolonged-release granules) = first licensed Rx for dRTA; better palatability in RCT  

NB K citrate improves bone health in healthy elderly!  

- MagTab SR = Mglactate = start 2 tabs bd  
- Organic Mg salts (aspartate or lactate) have better bioavailability than inorganic salts and therefore cause less diarrhoea  

<br>

Chronic hypoK probably okay; danger during intercurrent D&V.  

<br>
<br>

--> 

### RTA  

**Alkali supplements** for RTA (see [ESPN clinical practice points, NDT 2021](https://doi: 10.1093/ndt/gfab171)):  

- citrate unpalatable; longer half-life (as requires hepatic metabolism), more concentrated (2 - 3 mmmol/ml)  
- HCO3 associated with belching; less concentrated (1 mmol/ml)  
- microgranular formulation of K citrate and KHCO3 since 2017  
- usually 2 - 3 mmol/kg/day in adults (target HCO3, Cl, K and UCa); start at 60 mmol/day  
- may need additional KCl  
- avoid thaizides (will aggravate hypoK)  
- should have surveillance USS  

<br>

Uptodate:  

- see table 1 for options of alkali therapy  
- dRTA = start 80 - 120 mmol citrate (or HCO3) per day; usual maintenance 30 - 50 (or 1 - 2 mmol/kg/day)  
- pRTA needs much higher doses because therapeutic HCO3 load will exceed Tm and cause a bicarbonate diureis - therefore need 10 -- 15 mmmol/kg/day - may aggravate hypoK - so may need liquid sodium citrate as most concentrated  
- may need thiazides (to limit HCO3 wasting) / amiloride (to limit hypoK) in pRTA  

<br>
<br>

### Salt-losing nephropathy  

Rx of **Gitleman** (see [KDIGO controversies](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2016.09.046) and UKKA / RCA guidelines):  

- target K 3.0 mM and Mg 0.60 mM  
- use KCl, starting 40 mmol/day  
- not on an empty stomach; can give in water or syrup  
- inorganic Mg salts > low bioavailability > osmotic diarrhoea  
- organic salts (aspartate, citrate, lactate) better  
- start 300 mg (~12 mmol) per day as SR tabets, bd - qds with meals  
- only rarely amiloride / MRAs / indometacin  
- almost always avoid RASi (aggravate NaCl wasting) - unless 2ry FSGS  
- sick day rules (get bloods checked whenever unwell) - see supplemental table in KDIGO paper  
- elective surgery if K > 3 and Mg > 0.5
