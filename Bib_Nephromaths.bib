  abstract = {We performed studies on dogs under hydrated conditions, utilizing the rate of free water formation (CH2o) as an index of the rate of distal tubular sodium transport. Since CH2O could be progressively increased with no evidence of a maximal rate during loading with hypotonic (2.5\%) mannitol, it was concluded that there is no limit on distal tubular sodium transport during mannitol loading. In contrast, during hypotonic (0.45\%) saline loading CHvo rose initially, but as urine flow (V) exceeded 25\% of the filtered load CH2o attained maximal levels (up to 20\% of the filtered load) and remained stable as V increased to 50\% of the filtered load. It was concluded that saline loading progressively inhibits proximal sodium reabsorption. Initially, the distal tubule absorbs a large fraction of the proximal rejectate and sodium excretion rises slightly. Eventually, an alteration in distal sodium transport appears which culminates in a maximal rate or transport limit. This distal transport limit provoked by saline loading could not be characterized by a classical Tm as seen with glucose and does not seem to be consequent to high rates of flow through the distal tubule. Regardless of the precise nature of this limit, the major increment in sodium excretion develops during saline loading only after saline alters the capacity of the distal tubule to transport sodium.},

In light of these findings, a re-analysis of the role of Kϩ in modulating the [Naϩ]pw is required in understanding the pathophysiology of hypokalemia-induced hyponatremia. In this article, we characterize the complex role of Kϩ in the pathogenesis of hypokalemia-induced hyponatremia using a threecompartment model and the known parameters in the Edelman equation. Our analysis indicates that Kϩ modulates the [Naϩ]pw by changing Ke in addition to the parameters in the y-intercept of the Edelman equation. Moreover, the magnitude of potassium-induced changes in the [Naϩ]pw is determined by the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which changes in Ke occur.},

  abstract = {Hypernatremia usually results from the loss of water from the body in excess of loss of electrolytes. Although urinary loss of free water is usually thought of when the urine is dilute, it can also occur when the urine is relatively concentrated, for example after administration of osmotic diuretics. We present a case of hypernatremia in the setting of resolving acute renal failure. Quantitative analysis of urinary losses and the concept of electrolytefree water clearance help to explain the development and persistence of hypernatremia in this case. Urine in such cases is typically rich in urea (an irrelevant osmole from the perspective of plasma sodium) with low concentrations of sodium and potassium (osmoles that determine plasma sodium concentration). So from the perspective of plasma sodium-determining osmoles (sodium and potassium) this hyperosmolar urine is actually ``dilute'', resulting in loss of free water and a rise in the plasma sodium concentration. This case illustrates the utility of the electrolyte-free water concept in understanding the development of hypernatremia in resolving acute renal failure. We discuss the evolution of these concepts and how they can be applied to typical clinical situations.},

  shorttitle = {Whole-Body Electrolyte-Free Water Clearance},
  abstract = {The total exchangeable sodium (Nae), total exchangeable potassium (Ke), and total body water (TBW) are the major determinants of the plasma water sodium concentration ([Na+]pw). The relationship between [Na+]pw and Nae, Ke, and TBW was empirically determined by Edelman et al., where: [Na+]pw = 1.11(Nae + Ke)/TBW - 25.6 (Eq. 1). According to Eq. 1, changes in the mass balance of Na+, K+, and H2O will therefore result in changes in the [Na+]pw. Historically, in evaluating the pathogenesis of the dysnatremias, free water clearance (FWC) and electrolytefree water clearance (EFWC) have been used to evaluate the pathophysiology of the dysnatremias. However, such analyses are only valid when there is no concomitant input and non-renal output of Na+, K+, and H2O. Since the classic FWC and EFWC formulas fail to account for the input and non-renal output of Na+, K+, and H2O, these formulas cannot be used to evaluate the pathogenesis of the dysnatremias or to predict the directional change in the [Na+]pw. In this article, we have addressed this limitation by deriving a new formula, termed whole-body electrolyte-free water clearance (WB-EFWC), which calculates whole-body electrolyte-free water clearance for a given mass balance of Na+, K+, and H2O, rather than simply the urinary component (FWC, EFWC formulas). Unlike previous formulas, which consider only the renal component of electrolyte-free water clearance, WB-EFWC accounts for all sources of input and output of Na+, K+, and H2O, and will therefore be helpful in conceptually understanding the basis for changes in the [Na+]pw in patients with the dysnatremias.},

Three primary mechanisms of hypophosphatemia exist: increased renal excretion, decreased intestinal absorption, and shifts from the extracellular to intracellular compartments. Renal hypophosphatemia can be further divided into fibroblast growth factor 23-mediated or non-fibroblast growth factor 23-mediated causes. Proper diagnosis requires a thorough medication history, family history, physical examination, and assessment of renal tubular phosphate handling to identify the cause. During the past decade, our understanding of phosphate metabolism has grown greatly through the study of rare disorders of phosphate homeostasis. Treatment of hypophosphatemia depends on the underlying disorder and requires close biochemical monitoring.

Nephron segment studies strongly suggest the corrective response is orchestrated in the collecting duct, which has several transporters integral to acid-base regulation, the most important of which is pendrin, a luminal Cl/HCO(3)(-) exchanger. Chloride depletion alkalosis should replace the notion of contraction alkalosis.},

  abstract = {Nongap metabolic acidosis is a common form of both acute and chronic metabolic acidosis. Because derangements in renal acid-base regulation are a common cause of nongap metabolic acidosis, studies to evaluate renal acidification often serve as the mainstay of differential diagnosis. However, in many cases, information obtained from the history and physical examination, evaluation of the electrolyte pattern (to determine if a nongap acidosis alone or a combined nongap and high anion gap metabolic acidosis is present), and examination of the serum potassium concentration (to characterize the disorder as hyperkalemic or hypokalemic in nature) is sufficient to make a presumptive diagnosis without more sophisticated studies. If this information proves insufficient, indirect estimates or direct measurement of urinary NH(4)(+) concentration, measurement of urine pH, and assessment of urinary HCO(3)(-) excretion can help in establishing the diagnosis. This review summarizes current information concerning the pathophysiology of this electrolyte pattern and the value and limitations of all of the diagnostic studies available. It also provides a systematic and cost-effective approach to the differential diagnosis of nongap metabolic acidosis.},

  shorttitle = {Proximal Renal Tubular Acidosis},
  abstract = {Proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) (Type II RTA) is characterized by a defect in the ability to reabsorb HCO(3) in the proximal tubule. This is usually manifested as bicarbonate wastage in the urine reflecting that the defect in proximal tubular transport is severe enough that the capacity for bicarbonate reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and more distal nephron segments is overwhelmed. More subtle defects in proximal bicarbonate transport likely go clinically unrecognized owing to compensatory reabsorption of bicarbonate distally. Inherited proximal RTA is more commonly autosomal recessive and has been associated with mutations in the basolateral sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter (NBCe1). Mutations in this transporter lead to reduced activity and/or trafficking, thus disrupting the normal bicarbonate reabsorption process of the proximal tubules. As an isolated defect for bicarbonate transport, proximal RTA is rare and is more often associated with the Fanconi syndrome characterized by urinary wastage of solutes like phosphate, uric acid, glucose, amino acids, low-molecular-weight proteins as well as bicarbonate. A vast array of rare tubular disorders may cause proximal RTA but most commonly it is induced by drugs. With the exception of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors which cause isolated proximal RTA, drug-induced proximal RTA is associated with Fanconi syndrome. Drugs that have been recently recognized to cause severe proximal RTA with Fanconi syndrome include ifosfamide, valproic acid and various antiretrovirals such as Tenofovir particularly when given to human immunodeficiency virus patients receiving concomitantly protease inhibitors such as ritonavir or reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as didanosine.},

It is important to understand that despite knowing the disease for 60-70 years, complexities in the laboratory tests and their interpretation still make clinicians cautious to diagnose and label types of tubular disorder. Hence, we are writing this mini-review to emphasize on the step wise approach to RTA with some understanding on its basic etiopathogenesis. This will definitely help to have an accurate interpretation of urine and blood reports in correlation with the clinical condition. RTA can be a primary or secondary defect and results either due to abnormality in bicarbonate ion absorption or hydrogen ion secretion. Primary defects are common in children due to gene mutation or idiopathic nature while secondary forms are more common in adults. We are focusing and explaining here in this review all the clinical and laboratory parameters which are essential for making the diagnosis of RTA and excluding the extrarenal causes of hyperchloremic, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis.},

  abstract = {It is advantageous to make an independent assessment of the potassium (K) secretory process and the luminal flow rate in the renal cortex to evaluate K handling by the kidney during hypokalemia or hyperkalemia. The transtubular potassium concentration gradient (TTKG) is a semiquantitative index of the activity of the K secretory process. The purpose of this study was to define expected values for the TTKG in normal subjects with hypokalemia or following an acute K load. During hypokalemia of non-renal origin, the TTKG was 0.9 +/- 0.2; in contrast, the TTKG was significantly higher during the hypokalemia of hyperaldosteronism, 6.7 +/- 1.3. The TTKG was 11.8 +/- 3.6, 2 hours after normokalemic subjects received 0.2 mg 9 alpha-fludrocortisone (9 alpha-F). To obtain expected values during hyperkalemia, normal subjects ingested 50 mmol potassium chloride; 2 hours later, the TTKG was 13.1 +/- 3.8. Therefore, the expected value for the TTKG must be interpreted relative to the concentration of K in the plasma. Circumstances were also defined where the TTKG is low despite hyperaldosteronism, namely, during a water diuresis and pre-existing hypokalemia.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: 1) To determine the incidence and severity of hyperkalemia during trimethoprim therapy. 2) To test the hypothesis that trimethoprim inhibits renal potassium excretion by blocking sodium channels in the mammalian distal nephron.
PATIENTS: Thirty consecutive patients who were treated with trimethoprim-containing drugs. All patients included in the study had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS: Thirty-nine male Sprague-Dawley rats receiving normal rat chow and tap water (allowed free access).
INTERVENTION: Humans: high dose (20 mg/kg per day) of trimethoprim therapy. Rats: trimethoprim (9.6 mg/h per kg body weight) was infused intravenously or into the renal distal tubules (1 mmol/L).
MEASUREMENTS: Humans: Serum and urine electrolyte levels, serum creatinine, renin, aldosterone, and cortisol levels were measured, and the transtubular potassium gradient was calculated. Rats: The effects of trimethoprim infusion on urinary sodium, chloride, and potassium concentration and urine volume were measured. Sodium, chloride, potassium, and inulin concentrations were measured in fluid samples obtained from kidney distal tubules. The voltage across the wall of the distal tubule was measured.
RESULTS: Humans: Trimethoprim increased the serum potassium concentration by 0.6 mmol/L (95\% Cl, 0.29 to 0.95 mmol/L) despite normal adrenocortical function and glomerular filtration rate. Serum potassium levels greater than 5 mmol/L were observed during trimethoprim treatment in 15 of 30 patients. Rats: Intravenous trimethoprim inhibited renal potassium excretion by 40\% (Cl, 21\% to 60\%) and increased renal sodium excretion by 46\% (Cl, 9\% to 83\%). Trimethoprim (1 mmol/L) in tubule fluid inhibited distal tubule potassium secretion by 59\% (Cl, 26\% to 92\%) and depolarized the lumen-negative transepithelial voltage by 66\% (Cl, 46\% to 85\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Trimethoprim (an organic cation) acts like amiloride and blocks apical membrane sodium channels in the mammalian distal nephron. As a consequence, the transepithelial voltage is reduced and potassium secretion is inhibited. Decreased renal potassium excretion secondary to these direct effects on kidney tubules leads to hyperkalemia in a substantial number of patients being treated with trimethoprim-containing drugs.},

  abstract = {There have been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homoeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article we discuss these advances within a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences of hyperkalemia. We highlight aspects that are of particular relevance for clinical practice. Hyperkalemia occurs when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in glomerular filtration rate, tubular flow, distal sodium delivery or the expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion transporters in the distal nephron. Accordingly, the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal failure, diabetes mellitus, adrenal disease and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics. Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of death, and this is only in part explicable by hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to its well-established effects on cardiac excitability, hyperkalemia could also contribute to peripheral neuropathy and cause renal tubular acidosis. Hyperkalemia-or the fear of hyperkalemia-contributes to the underprescription of potentially beneficial medications, particularly in heart failure. The newer potassium binders could play a role in attempts to minimize reduced prescribing of renin-angiotensin inhibitors and mineraolocorticoid antagonists in this context.},

  abstract = {Antibiotics are among the most frequently prescribed drugs in medicine. Their use, however, is often limited by associated renal toxic effects. The most common manifestation of these toxic effects is decreased glomerular filtration rate. However, they can also occur while renal function remains near to normal. This Review focuses on antibiotic-associated fluid, electrolyte and acid-base disorders that do not greatly reduce glomerular filtration. Renal tubules can be affected by antibiotics at various locations. In the proximal tubule, toxic effects of tetracyclines and aminoglycosides can result in complete proximal tubular dysfunction, also known as Fanconi syndrome. Aminoglycosides (and capreomycin) can also affect the loop of Henle and lead to a Bartter-like syndrome. In the collecting ducts, antibiotics can cause a diverse range of disorders, including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, renal tubular acidosis, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Causative antibiotics include trimethoprim, amphotericin B, penicillins, ciprofloxacin, demeclocycline and various antitubercular agents. Here, we describe the mechanisms that disrupt renal tubular function. Integrated with the physiology of each successive nephron segment, we discuss the receptors, transporters, channels or pores that are affected by antibiotics. This insight should pave the way for pathophysiology-directed treatment of these disorders.},

  shorttitle = {Discriminative Power of Three Indices of Renal Calcium Excretion for the Distinction between Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcaemia and Primary Hyperparathyroidism},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia (FHH) must be differentiated from primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) because prognosis and treatment differ. In daily practice this discrimination is often based on the renal calcium excretion or the calcium/creatinine clearance ratio (CCCR). However, the diagnostic performance of these variables is poorly documented.
AIM: To appraise the power of various simple biochemical variables to differentiate between FHH and PHPT using calcium sensing receptor (CASR) gene analysis and histopathological findings as gold standards.
DESIGN: Follow-up approach (direct design).
MATERIALS: We included 54 FHH patients (17 males and 37 females, aged 18-75 years) with clinically significant mutations in the CASR gene and 97 hypercalcaemic patients with histologically verified PHPT (17 males and 80 females, aged 19-86 years). All PHPT patients became normocalcaemic following successful neck exploration.
RESULTS: Based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the CCCR was only marginally better, as judged by the area under curve (AUC = 0.923 +/- 0.021 (SE)), than the 24-h calcium/creatinine excretion ratio (AUC = 0.903 +/- 0.027) and the 24-h calcium excretion (AUC = 0.876 +/- 0.029). However, overlap performance analysis disclosed that the CCCR included fewer patients with PHPT together with the FHH patients than the other two variables at different cut-off points. Based on the ROC curve, the optimal cut-off point for diagnosing FHH using CCCR was {$<$} 0.0115, which yielded a diagnostic specificity of 0.88 and a sensitivity of 0.80. Overlap analysis revealed that a cut-off point for CCCR at {$<$} 0.020 would sample 98\% (53/54) of all patients with FHH and include 35\% (34/97) of the PHPT patients.
CONCLUSION: Our results support the use of the CCCR as an initial screening test for FHH. We suggest a two-step diagnostic procedure, where the first step is based on the CCCR with a cut-off at {$<$} 0.020, and the second step is CASR gene analysis in patients with FHH or PHPT.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypocalciuria is common in patients with Gitelman syndrome (GS), and its cause primarily is enhanced renal reabsorption of calcium in the proximal tubule in response to hypovolemia, judged by recent studies in animals.
STUDY DESIGN: Uncontrolled trial in cases and controls to evaluate the effect of acute reexpansion of extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) on urine calcium excretion in patients with GS.
SETTING \& PARTICIPANTS: 8 patients with GS and 8 sex- and age-matched healthy control subjects (CSs) were enrolled in an academic medical center.
PREDICTOR: ECFV expansion with isotonic saline at 1 L/h for 3 hours.
OUTCOMES \& MEASUREMENTS: Urinary calcium excretion was measured hourly for 6 hours, and subsequent 18-hour urine was analyzed as a single collection; hormones and electrolytes were measured.
RESULTS: Patients with GS had hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, severe hypocalciuria (urine calcium-creatinine ratio, 0.006 +/- 0.002 versus 0.08 +/- 0.02 mg/mg [0.02 +/- 0.01 versus 0.22 +/- 0.05 mmol/mmol]; P {$<$} 0.005), and a mild degree of ECFV contraction. Sodium excretion and creatinine clearance rates were similar to those in CSs. In patients with GS, saline infusion increased ECFV, which caused a significantly greater sodium excretion rate, but there was only a small increase in calcium excretion rate, in both the first 6 hours (0.04 +/- 0.02 mg/min [1.0 +/- 0.6 micromol/min]) and subsequent 18-hour period (0.02 +/- 0.01 mg/min [0.4 +/- 0.2 micromol/min]), as in CSs. Notwithstanding, their calcium excretion rate was still much less than that in CSs before volume repletion (0.13 +/- 0.04 mg/min [3.2 +/- 1.0 micromol/min]).
LIMITATION: Patients with GS did not become euvolemic on a long-term sodium chloride supplementation because they excreted sodium chloride so rapidly.
CONCLUSION: Hypovolemia is not the sole cause of hypocalciuria in patients with GS.},

Renal hypophosphatemia can be further divided into fibroblast growth factor 23-mediated or non-fibroblast growth factor 23-mediated causes. Proper diagnosis requires a thorough medication history, family history, physical examination, and assessment of renal tubular phosphate handling to identify the cause. During the past decade, our understanding of phosphate metabolism has grown greatly through the study of rare disorders of phosphate homeostasis.

  abstract = {There is considerable confusion about what ranges of dietary salt(a) could be considered low, normal, or high and also what ranges of reduction in dietary salt are small or large. The World Hypertension League with other organizations involved in dietary salt reduction have proposed a standardized nomenclature based on normal ancestral levels of salt intake and also on ranges of reduction in salt intake in clinical and population interventions. Low daily salt (sodium) intake where harm due to deficiency would be expected to occur is recommended to remain undefined because of inadequate research but likely {$<$}0.25 g (100 mg), normal (physiological) intake {$<$}2.5 g (1000 mg), recommended intake {$<$}5.0 g (2000 mg), high {$\geq$}5.0 g (2000 mg), very high {$>$}10 to 15 g (4000-6000 mg), and extremely high {$>$}15 g (6000 mg). Reductions in daily salt (sodium) intake are recommended to be called small if {$<$}2.5 g (1000 mg), moderate if 2.5 to 5.0 g (1000-2000 mg) and large if {$>$}5.0 g (2000 mg). Use of this nomenclature is likely to result in less confusion about salt intake and interventions to reduce dietary sodium.},

  abstract = {Assessment of the status of extracellular fluid volume is important in evaluating the cause and selecting appropriate therapy for hyponatremic disorders. Since the sensitivity and specificity of clinical assessment of extracellular fluid volume status in hyponatremic states remain unknown, 58 non-edematous patients with serum sodium less than 130 meq/liter were prospectively evaluated. Patients were judged to be either normovolemic (no response of serum sodium to saline infusion) or hypovolemic (saline infusion significantly corrected hyponatremia). Hypovolemic patients had significantly higher plasma renin activity (5.0 +/- 1.5 versus 2.5 +/- 0.5 ng/ml per three hours, p less than 0.05) and norepinephrine (1,054 +/- 252 versus 519 +/- 55 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) concentrations than did normovolemic patients. Clinical assessment correctly identified only 47 percent of hypovolemic patients and 48 percent of normovolemic patients. Thus, clinical assessment was of limited sensitivity and specificity in identifying extracellular fluid volume status in these hyponatremic patients. However, the concentration of sodium in a spot urine sample clearly separated hypovolemic (mean UNa = 18.4 +/- 3.1 meq/liter) from normovolemic (mean UNa = 72 +/- 3.7 meq/liter, p less than 0.001) hyponatremic patients.},

  abstract = {Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality. Its diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are in a state of flux. It is evident that hyponatremic patients are symptomatic with a potential for serious consequences at sodium levels that were once considered trivial. The recommendation to treat virtually all hyponatremics exposes the need to resolve the diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma of deciding whether to water restrict a patient with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) or administer salt and water to a renal salt waster. In this review, we briefly discuss the pathophysiology of SIADH and renal salt wasting (RSW), and the difficulty in differentiating SIADH from RSW, and review the origin of the perceived rarity of RSW, as well as the value of determining fractional excretion of urate (FEurate) in differentiating both syndromes, the high prevalence of RSW which highlights the inadequacy of the volume approach to hyponatremia, the importance of changing cerebral salt wasting to RSW, and the proposal to eliminate reset osmostat as a subtype of SIADH, and finally propose a new algorithm to replace the outmoded volume approach by highlighting FEurate. This algorithm eliminates the need to assess the volume status with less reliance on determining urine sodium concentration, plasma renin, aldosterone and atrial/brain natriuretic peptide or the BUN to creatinine ratio.},

  abstract = {Current teaching states that when sodium intake is increased from low to high levels, total-body sodium (TBNa) and water increase until daily sodium excretion again equals intake. When sodium intake is reduced, sodium excretion briefly exceeds intake until the excess TBNa and water are eliminated, at which point sodium excretion again equals intake. However, careful balance studies oftentimes conflict with this view and long-term studies suggest that TBNa fluctuates independent of intake or body weight. We recently performed the opposite experiment in that we fixed sodium intake for several weeks at three levels of sodium intake and collected all urine made. We found weekly (circaseptan) patterns in sodium excretion that were inversely related to aldosterone and directly to cortisol. TBNa was not dependent on sodium intake but instead exhibited far longer ({$\geq$} monthly) infradian rhythms independent of extracellular water, body weight, or blood pressure. The findings are consistent with our ideas on tissue sodium storage and its regulation that we developed on the basis of animal research. We are implementing (23)Na-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to pursue open questions on sodium balance in patients. Our findings could be relevant to therapeutic strategies for hypertension and target-organ damage.},

  abstract = {A ovolactovegetarian patient presented with hyponatremia. She had maximally dilute urine and undetectable vasopressin levels. Dietary history revealed very low protein intake but no beer intake. We postulated that the very low intake of solute limited her water excretion and caused the hyponatremia despite only a modest increase in fluid intake. When protein intake was increased in a clinical research center setting, free water excretion increased and serum sodium normalized despite maintaining the water intake at 4 to 5 L daily. We discuss the role of dietary solute in water excretion. Previously described in beer drinkers, the phenomenon can occur in the absence of beer drinking. In this era of weight consciousness, hyponatremia because of low solute intake may be seen with increased frequency.},

Chronic bicarbonate replacement is obviously indicated for patients who continue to lose bicarbonate in the ambulatory setting, particularly patients with renal tubular acidosis syndromes or diarrhea. In patients with acute lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis, lactate and ketone bodies can be converted back to bicarbonate if the clinical situation improves. For these patients, therapy must be individualized. In general, bicarbonate should be given at an arterial blood pH of {$<$} or =7.0. The amount given should be what is calculated to bring the pH up to 7.2. The urge to give bicarbonate to a patient with severe acidemia is apt to be all but irresistible. Intervention should be restrained, however, unless the clinical situation clearly suggests benefit. Here we discuss the pros and cons of bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidosis.},
