# Disclaimer {- #disc}
This short book aims to provide a quick reference guide for clinicians who wish to use equations to better understand disorders in electrolyte and acid-base homeostasis.  

It is important to state that such analysis can **never** be used in isolation to make reliable clinical descisions.  Equations can provide a useful adjunct to clinical judgement, but thoughtful clinical judgement is far more likely to lead to accurate diagnosis and successful treatment than is "number crunching". Therefore this book does **not** aim to replace the judgement of clinicians. 

For a broader discussion of the **major limitations** inherent in attempts to use equations to guide clinical descision-making see [chapter 2](#validity).

# Acknowledgements {-}
I would like to thank John Neary (Renal Physician, Edinburgh) and Matthew Bailey (Professor of Renal Physiology) for teaching me most of what I know about electrolyte disorders over the years.  Also Ben Walsh at UCL for answering all my tricky questions and for explaining renal tubular physiology in a more engaging, accessibly and entertaining way than anybody else ever could.
