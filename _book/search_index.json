It is important to state that such analysis can never be used in isolation to make reliable clinical descisions. Equations can provide a useful adjunct to clinical judgement, but thoughtful clinical judgement is far more likely to lead to accurate diagnosis and successful treatment than is “number crunching”. Therefore this book does not aim to replace the judgement of clinicians.

Long before we learnt of their molecular basis, the fundamental processes of the kidney were understood by Homer Smith and others in terms of simple quantitative models. In learning these models, the student of nephrology comes to understand the physical basis of the underlying physiology. For example, the fractional excretion (2.2) of a substance is a concept that considers glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption as independent, sequential processes: as they are in reality. Moreover these equations can be used to diagnose electrolyte and acid-base disorders and to guide their clinical management. However, the equations can be difficult to remember, as can the assumptions that underlie their validity. As a result they are often not applied – or worse, misapplied. Therefore this book aims to provide a quick-reference guide to clinicians wishing to use simple calculations to help diagnose and treat disorders in electrolyte and acid-base homeostasis. 1.1 Work in progress At present this is a somewhat rough-and-ready collection of short notes. It is very much a work in progress. However - in the spirit of #FOAM - I will keep it in the public domain as I edit and update it. Any comments are very gratefully received (@renalrob on twitter). 1.2 What this book is - and what it is not This book was initially written as a personal, quick-reference aide-memoire. It is written for those moments when one cannot quite remember how to interpret a TTKG or whether you are supposed to add-on or subtract to correct the anion gap in hypoalbuminaemia. It assumes a certain amount of pre-existing knowledge of basic electrolyte, acid-base and renal physiology. This book does not aim to act as a guide to clinical management (for the reasons stated in the disclaimer). Neither does this book aim to provide a comprehensive discussion of renal or fluid-electrolyte physiology; there are plenty of excellent books and articles that already do this. 1.3 How to use this book This book was written so that it should be easy to read on a smartphone. However, some of the tables and equation panels will only render correctly when the phone is held in landscape orientation. Equations are in blue panels, along with any associated notes or assumptions. Clinical checklists or algorithms are in yellow panels. A guide to notation and glossary of abbrevations is given in appendix 1. "],["basic-concepts.html", "Chapter 2 Basic Concepts 2.1 Validity &amp; assumptions 2.2 General principles", " Chapter 2 Basic Concepts This book does not aim to provide a comprehensive overview of fluid-electrolyte physiology. However, it will be useful to begin with a brief revision of a few key concepts. 2.1 Validity &amp; assumptions All equations represent a model that has inherent assumptions. These assumptions may or may not be explicitly stated alongside any given equation. However, it is always worth considering what those assumptions might be. For example, most equations (such as those used to estimate GFR from PCr) assume that the body is a closed system in a state of equilibrium. Some equations, such as that used to calculate the TTKG (5.1) rely on a series of relatively complex assumptions (in this case concerning delivery of sodium to the distal tubule and the vasopressin status). Almost invariably these assumptions - whilst necessary to produce a simple mathematical model - are totally unreasonable from a biological standpoint. Living organisms are not closed systems and never in a state of equilibrium. So most of the time, the assumptions on which any given equation is predicated will have been violated. This may not always be so serious a breach as to invalidate any result. But one should always bear in mind that the validity of any result will often be compromised. That is one of the main reasons why – as discussed in the introduction and disclaimer – the equations in this book should not be used in isolation to inform clinical decision-making. The major value of these equations is in their educational potential. By understanding the models that they represent, one can better understand physiological prinicples. The classic example here is the equation used to calculate the fractional excretion of sodium, FENa (4.9). THis equation can be a great way of understanding or explaining the filtration-reabsorption model of renal function and of how renal sodium and water handling can be perturbed in pre-renal vs intrinsic renal failure; however it’s ability to differentiate pre-renal from intrinsic renal failure in the clinic is poor (Pahwa &amp; Sperati, 2016). 2.2 General principles 2.2.1 Balance For much of the time, we live in a state of fluid-electrolyte equilibrium - or “balance”. For any given substance (water, sodium, potassium etc.), the rate of excretion from the body matches rate of ingestion and therefore total body levels remain constant. Physiological perturbations can temporarily disrupt this equilibrium, causing a period of &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; balance. For example, we might enter a period of positive potassium balance after switching from a low- to a high-K diet; we might enter a period of negative potassium balance after vomiting. We might enter a period of positive sodium balance if we develop heart failure; we enter a period of negative sodium balance when we start diuretic therapy. Following any of these perturbations - if given enough time - we will enter a new state of equilibrium. The patient starting on diuretics will enter a period of negative sodium balance (in which urinary losses exceed dietary intake) before eventually settling out in a new state of equilibrium in which losses again match intake, but at a lower total-body sodium. “Balance studies” in which the intake and losses are meticulously measured in humans or experimental animals are used by researchers investigating fluid-electrolyte balance. (And in some cases, suprising results have lead to the discovery of new physiological processes - such as non-osmotic sodium storage (Titze et al., 2014)). When interpreting plasma / urinary electrolytes, it is always useful to consider whether the patient is likely to be in a state of neutral, positive or negative balance. Some calculations assume neutral balance. 2.2.2 Testing during stress &amp; “normal ranges” During normal physiology, the renal excretion of most substances varies in proportion to dietary intake - in order to maintain balance. Therefore the concept of a “normal range” for urinary electrolytes does not really apply in the same way as it does for plasma (in which electrolyte concentrations are maintained within a very tight range). Therefore it can be impossible to tell whether a value for UOsm, UNa, UK etc. is normal or abnormal, without interpreting this in the clinical context. During periods of physiological stress however, urinary electrolytes can be interpret with reference to the expected renal response to that stress. For example, in water excess when the plasma is hypotonic, a normal kidney would be expected to produce a dilute urine (UOsm &lt; 100 mOsm) and if that is not observed then we can deduce that there is some impediment to renal water excretion. For example, during potassium depletion we expect the kidney to conserve potassum (UK &lt; 20 mM; TTKG &lt; 2) and if that is not observed then we can infer a renal cause for any hypokalaemia. 2.2.3 Renal clearance &amp; fractional excretion The renal clearance of a substance is the hypothetical volume of plasma from which that substance is removed by the kidneys, per unit time. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{clearance, }C_{X} = \\frac{U_{X} \\times V}{P_{X}} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] The clearance of a substance (such as inulin or creatinine) that is freely filtered by the glomerulus but neither secreted or reabsorped by the renal tubules will be the same as the glomerular filtration rate. The clearance of other substances can be compared to that of creatinine (or inulin) in order to make inferences about how they are handled by the renal tubules. The fractional excretion of a substance is the proportion of the filtered load that is ultimately excreted in the urine. The tubular reabsorption is the proportion of the filtered load that is re-absorbed by the renal tubules. (These represent net excretion or re-absorption; many substances - such as K+ - are both secreted into and reabsorbed from the tubular fluid.) \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{fractional excretion, }FE_{X} = \\frac{U_{X}}{P_{X}} \\times \\frac{P_{Creat}}{U_{Creat}} \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] Note that for substances (such as Mg2+) that are heavily protein-bound in plasma, a correction factor is applied to account for the fact that not all of plasma X is availble to be filtered. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{tubular reabsorption, }TR_{X} = 1-FE_{X} \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] 2.2.4 Tmax The maximum transport capacity of the renal tubules for a given substance is termed the T~max~. This concept is helpful when thinking about glucose and phosphate which will appear in the urine when the filtered load exceeds this threshold. 2.2.5 Osmolarity, osmolality &amp; tonicity The osmolarity and osmolality of a solution express the concentration of osmoles (per unit volume or unit weight respectively). Tonicity expresses the ability of a solution to induce osmotic water shifts across a given semi-permable membrane. This will be determined by the osmolarily (or osmolality) of the solution and the ability of its constituent osmoles to cross the semi-permeable membrane in question. Substances that freely cross the membrane are known as ineffective osmoles - e.g. urea for cell membranes. Substances that do NOT freely cross the membrane are effective osmoles - e.g. glucose for cell membranes. 2.2.6 Gaps Some substances cannot be measured directly in plasma or urine - either because we lack an excessible, reliable assay (e.g. as for urinary ammonium) or because we do not know what the substance is (e.g. following the ingestion of an unknown exogenous acid). In this case, the presence of the substance can be inferred by calculating a gap. For example, the law of electroneutrality dictates that the concentration of cations and anions in solution must be equal. The presence of an exogenous anion in the plasma will manifest as an apparent anion gap (6.3). Similarly, the presence of an exogenous osmole will manifest as an osmolar gap between measured and calculated osmolality (6.10). One must remember the potential sources of error when calculating anion gaps: "],["general-approach-to-a-patient-with-electrolyte-disturbance.html", "Chapter 3 General approach to a patient with electrolyte disturbance 3.1 Vomiting &amp; diarrhoea 3.2 Drugs 3.3 IV fluids &amp; electrolyte supplements 3.4 Diet 3.5 Basic set of investigations", " Chapter 3 General approach to a patient with electrolyte disturbance In the following chapters, we will consider specific electrolyte or acid-base disorders. However the clinical approaches to these very different disorders have much in common. For any disturbance in electrolyte or acid-base homeostasis it is usually worth starting with a few basic questions: is there a history of vomiting, diarrhoea (or other gastrointestinal losses - e.g. biliary drains)? what is the current volume status / effective arterial blood volume (EABV)? are there any potential culprit drugs - including IV fluids? what is the diet? 3.1 Vomiting &amp; diarrhoea 3.1.1 Electrolyte content of GI fluids fluid Na (mM) K (mM) Cl (mM) HCO3 (mM) vomit 60 10 120 0 diarrhoea 75 30 60 40 ileostomy fluid 100 10 100 30 bile 150 6 100 40 pancreatic juice 140 5 75 140 (from FLUID THERAPY and disorders of electrolye balance, WH Taylor, 1970 &amp; (Gennari &amp; Weise, 2008)). 3.1.2 Vomiting The consequences of vomiting are reasonably complex. Chloride loss leads to a metabolic alkalosis and the subsequent bicarbonaturia - and aldosterone secretion - lead to urinary losses of potassium (and to a lesser extent sodium) (Galla, 2000; Gennari &amp; Weise, 2008; Luke &amp; Galla, 2012). In the generation phase of the metabolic alkalosis, gastric acid secretion (to compensate for losses in vomiting) is accompanied by secretion of HCO3 into the systemic circulation. Initially this excess bicarbonate spills over into the urine, with the bicarbonaturia driving renal sodium and potassium loss. In the maintenence phase, several renal tubular processes act to sustain the metabolic alkalosis. These are indicated by the numbers in the diagram below: volume depletion causes increased NHE3 activity low [Cl] at MD stimulates renin release (and hence aldosterone) - contributing to kaliuresis lack of distal tubular Cl limits Cl/HCO3 exchange by pendrin and hence stops HCO3 secretion by B-type intercalated cells lack of distal tubular Cl favours electrogenic Na+ exchange – hence H+ excretion and K+ excretion This results in a paradoxically acid urine and kaliuresis. Burton Rose described two phases of the renal response to vomiting: early (&lt; 3 days) : pH &gt; 6.5, high Na, high K, low Cl, high HCO3 (all high except chloride) late (day 4+) : pH &lt; 5.5, low Na, low K, low Cl, low HCO3 (all low) Early after vomiting, metabolic alkalosis means that XS HCO3 is filtered, and the kidney cannot reabsorb this. Therefore bicarbonaturia drives natriuresis and kaliuresis (from increased distal Na delivery +/- volume contraction simulating aldosterone). By day 4, the kidney has upregulated ability to reabsorb HCO3, so natriuresis and kaliuresis abates, with paradoxically acid urine. 3.1.3 Quantitative assessment after vomiting One entertaining exercise is to use the extent of any metabolic alkalosis to estimate the volume of vomitus (Kamel et al., 1990). The volume of distribution of bicarbonate approximates to total body water, TBW (4.1) (Sabatini &amp; Kurtzman, 2009). Therefore we can calculate: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{mmoles of HCO3 loss} = TBW \\times (P_{HCO_3} - 26) \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] Then assuming that the net loss of gastric HCl (in mmoles) is equal to the net gain of bicarbonate (in mmoles) and that vomits contains ~100 mM HCl, we can calculate that: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{volume of vomit (litres)} = \\frac{\\text{mmoles of HCO3 loss}}{100 \\text{mmoles}} \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] This will of course under-estimate the true volume of vomit as it does not take into account bicarbonate loss in the urine. 3.1.4 Diarrhoea The consequences of diarrhoea are a little more straightforward. GI losses of bicarbonate and potassium tend to give rise to a metabolic (hyperchloraemic) acidosis and hypokalaemia (Gennari &amp; Weise, 2008). 3.2 Drugs Many drugs can affect renal electrolyte handling. Some will be obvious (e.g. renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and diuretics); some are less so. It is worth paying particular attention to antimicrobial agents (Zietse et al., 2009), anti-virals, PPIs and chemotherapy. Ask about drug exposure in the past; drugs such as cisplatin or lithium can cause changes in renal electrolyte handling that persist for many years. 3.3 IV fluids &amp; electrolyte supplements 0.9% NaCl can induce a hyperchloraemic acidosis. Balanced crystalloids contain lactate, acetate or gluconate, which are metabolised to bicarbonate. Plasmalyte-148 contains 27 mM acetate and 23 mM gluconate = 50 mM bicarbonate-equivalents. It is helpful to consider electrolyte supplements in the context of normal dietary intake: source Na K Cl HCO3 urea typical daily Western diet 160 60 - - - WHO daily recommendations &lt; 90 &gt; 90 - - - total body K (50 mmol per kg) - 3000 - - - 1L 0.9% NaCl 154 - 154 - - 1L plasmalyte-148 140 5 98 50 - 2 tabs slow sodium tds 60 - 60 - - 2 tabs sando-K tds - 75 48 24 - 10 ml K citrate - 30 - 12 - 10 ml Kay-Cee-L - 10 10 - - 1L 1.26% NaHCO3 150 - - 150 - 50 ml 8.4 % NaHCO3 - - - 50 - 1g NaHCO3 tds 36 - - 36 - 10g protein - - - - 50 NB the values (all mmoles) in the table above are very approximate; HCO3 refers to bicarbonate or bicarbonate-equivalents (i.e. substances that will be metabolised to bicarbonate). Citrate often preferred to HCO3 (either as NaHCO3 or in sando-K) for long-term supplementation in RTA for three reasons: because will correct hypocituria (and reduce stone risk); will avoid a sodium load (in NaHCO3) which will increase UCa and increase stone risk; bicarbonate can be poorly tolerated as it is converted to CO2 in the stomach, causing bloating. Conversion of citrate may be impaired in liver disease. 3.4 Diet Meat-based diets generate acid. H+ production is approximately 1mmol/kg body weight on an omnivorous diet. A diet based on fruit and vegetables will generate an alkali load (Kamel et al., 1990). 3.5 Basic set of investigations Ideally, investigations should be targeted to address a specific clinic question. However, electrolyte disorders can be confusing and there is not always time to think things through thoroughly at the time of initial assessment. A general set of investigations that are useful in most circumstances are given in the box below. Ideally these should be sent before any therapeutic manoeuvres that might alter the results (e.g. IV fluids). If in doubt, send the following samples and think about it later: Blood for: U&amp;Es HCO3 (sometimes called TCO2) Cl– glucose albumin osmolality A spot urine sample for: Na+ K+ Cl– osmolality "],["water-and-sodium.html", "Chapter 4 Water and sodium 4.1 Total body water 4.2 Plasma sodium 4.3 Renal water excretion 4.4 Urine osmolality 4.5 Hyponatraemia 4.6 Free water clearance 4.7 Hypernatraemia", " Chapter 4 Water and sodium 4.1 Total body water Sometimes it is helpful to estimate total body water. (For example, this is a prerequisite to calculating water excess (4.16) in hyponatraemia or water deficit in hypernatraemia (4.17).) \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{total body water, }TBW = \\text{body weight}\\times k \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] where k= 0.6 in men; 0.5 in women, elderly men or obesity and 0.45 in elderly women. An appropriate value for k - taking into account sex and body habitus - should be estimated, bearing in mind that muscle is ~70% water and adipose tissue is ~10% water. 4.2 Plasma sodium Na+ is the dominant extracellular cation and, as such, its concentration depends on the total body stores of water and exchangeable ions. Na+ and K+ are the most abundant cations (and will be accompanied by anions to maintain electroneutrality), thus: The Edelman equation: \\[\\begin{equation} P_{Na} = \\frac{Na_{e} + K_{e}}{TBW} \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] …where Na(e) and K(e) are exchangeable sodium and potassium and TBW is total body water. For an elegant discussion of the derivation of this equation see (Rose, 1986). Any abnormality in plasma sodium concentration (PNa) usually reflects a problem with water homeostasis. Hyponatraemia = over-hydration; hypernatraemia = dehydration. The role of potassium is often under-appreciated. Depletion of total body potassium (e.g. after vomiting, diarrhoea or diuretic use) can result in hyponatraemia; replenishing K+ stores can help to correct this (Rose, 1986). Plasma tonicity is regulated through a negative-feedback loop, with renal free-water excretion as the effector arm: 4.3 Renal water excretion The kidneys are able to respond to purturbations in water balance by generating a dilute or a concentrated urine, varying UOsm in the range 50 - 900 mOsm/kg (Lote, 2012). Production of a dilute urine (i.e. excretion of free water) relies on three processes: glomerular filtration (of water and solute) generation of lumenal free water in the water-impermeable diluting segment (thick ascending loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule) excretion of free water in water-impermeable collecting ducts in the absence of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) Production of a concentrated urine (i.e. retention of free water) relies on: the generation of a concentrated inner medulla (due to the action of countercurrent multiplier in the loop of Henle and urea recycling); the reabsorption of water from the collecting ducts in the presence of ADH The range over which the kidneys can vary UOsm may be limited by anything that can limit these processes (e.g. chronic renal insufficiency, diuretics, unregulated ADH secretion). The ability of the kidneys to excrete free water is determined by UOsm and by the total osmolar content of the urine, as we shall see (4.3). A large osmolar load will drive a solute diuresis; a low amount of filtered solute will limit water excretion. 4.4 Urine osmolality When an osmolar load (OL) is excreted in a discrete volume of urine (V), those two variables will determine the urine osmolality (UOsm): \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{urine osmolality, } U_{Osm} = \\frac{OL}{V} \\tag{4.3} \\end{equation}\\] which, when re-arranged becomes: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{urine volume, } V = \\frac{OL}{U_{Osm}} \\tag{4.4} \\end{equation}\\] The reciprocal relationship between V and UOsm means that the maximum urine volume used to excrete an osmolar load is determined by the lowest achievable urine osmolality in diuresis (and the minimum urine volume by the maximum possible urine osmolality in antidiuresis): \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{maximum urine volume, } V_{max} = \\frac{OL}{U_{Osm_{min}}} \\tag{4.5} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{minimum urine volume, } V_{min} = \\frac{OL}{U_{Osm_{max}}} \\tag{4.6} \\end{equation}\\] These simple relationships can be used to explore a number of phenomena, such as: explaining why drinking seawater causes dehydration explaining why giving 0.9% NaCl can exacerbate hyponatraemia in some circumstances calculating the water intake that would cause hyponatraemia explaining why poor diet (low dietary solute intake) can cause hyponatraemia These are considered in more detail in Appendix 2. 4.5 Hyponatraemia Hyponatraemia is caused by free water excess. When this is associated with reduced plasma tonicity, this can cause cerebral oedema. The general approach to diagnosis is as follows: Order of operations in hyponatraemia: confirm true hypotonic hyponatraemia correct for [glucose] in hyperglycaemia check POsm determine clinical volume status check UOsm (&lt; 100 mM suggests urine water excretion limited by low solute load or driven by XS water intake - i.e. hypothalamic-ADH-kidney axis intact) check UNa (&lt; 30 mM suggests low effective arterial blood volume) And remember to consider: is there total body K depletion? is solute intake low? check UK or calculate free water clearance to guide therapy calculate FEurate in tricky cases The causes of hyponatraemia can be classified by volume status, UOsm and UNa: 4.5.1 Drug causes of hyponatraemia 4.5.2 Correction for hyperglycaemia Hyponatraemia can result from an influx of water into the vascular (and interstitial) space in presence of an abnormaly high concentration of a plasma osmole. The commonest such clinical scenario is that of hyperglycaemia. (Hyponatraemia in this context is not dangerous per se because plasma tonicity is maintained near normal by glucose, an effective osmole.) The value that PNa will correct to with resolution of hyperglycaemia can be estimated: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{corrected } P_{Na}, cP_{Na} = P_{Na}+2.4 \\times \\frac{P_{glucose}-5.5\\text{mM}}{\\text{5.5mM}} \\tag{4.7} \\end{equation}\\] NB alternatively this can calculated by adding 0.4 mM to measured PNa for every 1 mM rise in Pglucose. The correction factor for haemodialysis patients is lower (0.27 mM for every 1 mM glucose) (Penne et al., 2010). 4.5.3 Urine sodium In the steady-state, urinary sodium excretion will reflect sodium intake. On a normal Western diet, daily NaCl intake might be ~9g (=154 mmoles) (Campbell et al., 2015). If this were excreted in 2L or urine, then UNa would be ~ 77mM. When volume homeostasis is threatened and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is activated, renal sodium reabsorption is stimulated and UNa drops. As a rule-of-thumb, UNa is &lt; 30 mM in volume depletion: \\[\\begin{equation} U_{Na}&lt;30\\text{mM }=\\text{low effective artieral blood volume} \\tag{4.8} \\end{equation}\\] This threshold was derived in an elegant study of patients with hyponatraemia in which bona fide volume depletion was determined retrospectively by a positive response to a crystalloid bolus (Chung et al., 1987). It is more accurate to say that low UNa refects low effective arterial blood volume (EABV) rather than volume depletion per se). This hypothetical concept encompasses both intravascular volume and vascular tone, and is useful in explaining why the RAAS is activated in hypervolaemic (but low-perfusion) states such as heart failure and cirrhosis. UNa will not accurately report EABV in the presence of any drug or disease that perturbs renal sodium excretion, such as: diuretics ATN salt-wasting nephropathies (Addison’s, Barrter, Gitelman) bicarbonaturia (look for low UCl) glycosuria 4.5.3.1 FENa Urine sodium levels can be expressed as a fractional excretion. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{fractional excretion, }FE_{Na} = \\frac{U_{Na}}{P_{Na}} \\times \\frac{P_{Creat}}{U_{Creat}} \\tag{4.9} \\end{equation}\\] Historically, FENa was used in an attempt to discriminate between an appropriate response to volume depletion in “pre-renal” AKI (FENa &lt; 1%) and in-appropriate salt wasting in ATN (FENa &gt; 3%). However, the sensitivity and specificity of FENa in this context are poor (Pahwa &amp; Sperati, 2016). (FEurea can be used in a similar way and is less sensitive to error in patients who are treated with diuretics; FEurea &lt; 35% is compatible with pre-renal AKI.) FENa may be more useful in identifying patients exhibiting hepato-renal physiology (in which FENa &lt;&lt; 1% and UNa &lt; 10 mM). 4.5.4 FEurate as an alternative index of volume status Urate transport in PCT is coupled to sodium transport (Kahn, 1989). Volume depletion will stimulate Na reabsorption in PCT and hence also urate reabsorption. Interpretation(Maesaka et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2018): in normal subjects, FEurate is 4 – 11% in volume depletion (or states of low EABV), FEurate is low (&lt; 4%) in volume expansion, SiADH or renal salt wasting, FEurate is high (&gt; 11%) 4.6 Free water clearance 4.6.1 Calculating free water clearance The quantitative contribution of the kidney to water homeostasis can be determined by calculating the osmolar- or electrolyte-free water clearance. A dilute urine can be thought of as comprising a volume of urine that is isotonic with plasma PLUS a volume of “free” water. A concentrated urine can be thought of as a volume of isotonic urine MINUS a volume of “free” water. Free water clearance is a hypothetical concept that determines this volume of “free” water in the urine. Traditionally, this was calculated by first determinine the total clearance of osmoles and subtracting this from urine flow: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{osmolar clearance, }C_{Osm} = \\frac{U_{Osm} \\times V}{P_{Osm}} \\tag{4.10} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{free water clearance, }C_{H_{2}O} = V-C_{Osm}=V \\times(1-\\frac{U_{Osm}}{P_{Osm}})=\\frac{OL}{U_{Osm}}\\times(1-\\frac{U_{Osm}}{P_{Osm}}) \\tag{4.11} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{free water reabsorption, }T^{C}_{H_{2}O} = C_{Osm}-V \\tag{4.12} \\end{equation}\\] However, as not all urinary osmoles are effective osmoles with respect to cell membranes, it makes more sense to determine the clearance of water that is free from only effective osmoles when working out how renal water clearance is likely to affect PNa. Therefore, it is usually preferable to calculate electrolyte-free water clearance (Nguyen &amp; Kurtz, 2006): \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{electrolyte-free water clearance, }C_{H_{2}O}(e) = V\\times(1-\\frac{U_{Na}+U_{K}+U_{OEOs}}{P_{Na}+P_{OEOs}})\\\\ \\approx\\frac{OL}{U_{Osm}}\\times(1-\\frac{U_{Na}+U_{K}}{P_{Na}}) \\tag{4.13} \\end{equation}\\] Other effective osmoles (OEOs) may be: glucose, mannitol… Most of the time, this can be simplified by considering only the dominiant urinary cations, sodium and potassium. The urine:plasma electrolyte ratio is a related concept: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{electrolyte clearance, }C_{El} = \\frac{U_{Na+K}\\times V}{P_{Na}} \\tag{4.14} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{urine:plasma electrolyte ratio, U:P(e)} = \\frac{U_{Na}+U_{K}}{P_{Na}} \\tag{4.15} \\end{equation}\\] 4.6.2 Clinical utility of free water clearance The main clinical application of free water clearance is in determinine the quantitative contribution of the kidneys to the pathogenesis of hyponatraemia. This can help if diagnosing the cause of hyponatraemia and in guiding rational therapy. Hyponatraemia will ensue when free water intake exceed free water clearance. A low free water clearance, in the context of hyponatraemia, indicates some sort of problem with the ADH-kidney axis. Free water clearance can be used to determine the extent to which water intake should be restricted (in cases of euvolaemia or volume-expanded hyponatraemia where this should help to correct hyponatraemia). A meticulous approach entails calculating \\(C_{H_{2}O}(e)\\) and using this to set a value for the daily water intake that would result in hyponatraemia - accounting for any insensible water losses and obligate free water intake. A more straightforward approach - and one that can be followed when urine flow rate has not been documented - is to approximate \\(C_{H_{2}O}(e)\\) from the urine:plasma electrolyte ratio (4.15) - sometimes known as the “Furst ratio” (Furst et al., 2000). The Furst formula makes various assumptions about body size, cation intake and insensible water losses in order to give a very approximate estimate of urinary free water excretion. The estimates for net free water loss (and the restriction on water intake that would be required to raise plasma sodium) are as follows, with the duration being that required for 1L of urine output: U:P electrolyte ratio estimated net free water loss max fluid intake &gt;1.0 800 ml 0 ml 0.5 – 1.0 800 - 1300 ml 500 ml &lt;0.5 1300 - 1800 ml 1000 ml Based on this, Joel Topft and others have proposed an approximate guide to fluid restriction: U:P electrolytes set fluid restriction to… UNa + UK &gt; PNa 500 ml (and give furosemide bd) UNa + UK ~ PNa 500 - 800 ml UNa + UK &lt; PNa &gt;1000 ml 4.6.3 Drug causes of hyponatraemia Mechanism Drugs Impaired urinary dilution thiazide diuretics Renal salt wasting NSAIDs / antibiotics / PPIs (if AIN) SIADH antidepressants (SSRIs, TCAs) antipsychotics anticonvulsants (esp. carbemazepine) anti-cancer (vinscritine, cisplatin…) opioids MDMA Reset osmostat venlafaxine carbamazepine Excessive thirst MDMA 4.7 Hypernatraemia In contrast to hyponatraemia, which may pose a diagnostic conundrum, in hypernatraemia it is almost always easy to work out the underlying cause. Hypernatraemia is caused by loss of free water (dehydration). Because the thirst resoponse is such a powerful negative feedback controlled of POsm, in most cases hypernatraemia arises through lack of access to water rather than excessive water losses per se. This is often iatrogenic: a classic example being the patient with chronic diabetes insipidus who, having been used to drinking many litres of water per day, becomes hypernatraemic when they are admitted to hospital and their access to water is limited. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{water excess } = TBW \\times (1-\\frac{P_{Na}}{140}) \\tag{4.16} \\end{equation}\\] The treatment of hypernatraemia is simple: give more free water (either enterally or as intravenous 5% glucose). The total body water deficit can be estimated as follows (where total body water, TBW is given by (4.1)): \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{water defecit } = TBW \\times (\\frac{P_{Na}}{140}-1)\\approx \\frac{P_{Na}-140}{3} \\tag{4.17} \\end{equation}\\] Armed with this estimate, fluid may be prescribed at an appropriate rate to achieve gradual restoration of normal plasma tonicity.

In many cases, a 24 hr urine collection will give the most definitive result. FEK usually 5 – 15 % (can vary 2 – 150 % in response to variations in K intake). 5.1.1 Interpretation In hypokalaemia, the following are indicative of EXTRA-renal loss: 24 hr UK &lt; 20 mmoles UK &lt; 20 mM UK:UCr &lt; 1.5 FEK &lt; 2 – 3 % TTKG &lt; 2 In hypokalaemia, the following are indicative of RENAL loss: 24 hr UK &gt; 20 mmoles UK &gt; 20 mM UK:UCr &gt; 1.5 FEK &gt; 10 – 15 % TTKG &gt;&gt; 3 These metrics were compared in a Taiwanese cohort of patients with hypokalaemia and paralysis. TTKG (with threshold ~ 3) and UK:UCr (threshold ~ 2.5 mmol/mmol) were able to neatly discriminate between HPP (i.e. non-renal cause) and non-HPP (predominantly renal causes = Gitelman and RTA). Spot urine UK was not reliable: below 10 mM were all HPP; above 15 mM were all non-HPP but 10 – 15 mM could be either. 5.2 TTKG The TTKG is used to estimate [K+] in the tubular fluid at the end of the CCD (i.e. the point where the tubular fluid was last isotonic to plasma). It accounts for water reabsorption in the MCD. Therefore it is a measure of renal K+ secretion – and of mineralocorticoid bioactivity in the CCD. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{transtubular potassium gradient, } TTKG=\\frac{\\frac{U_{K}}{P_{K}}}{\\frac{U_{Osm}}{P_{Osm}}}=\\frac{U_{K}\\times P_{Osm}}{P_{K}\\times {U_{Osm}}} \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] Assumptions &amp; pre-requisites The validity of the TTKG as a measure of luminal [K+] in the CCD relies on a number of assumptions: there is no K reabsorption or secretion in the MCD (valid except in profound K deficiency / XS) other solutes (Na / urea) are not secreted or reabsorbed in large amounts in the MCD the osmolality of the tubular fluid at the end of the CCD is similar to POsm These assumptions are likely to be met if the following are true: UNa &gt; 25 mM = 2 × maximal [Na+] required for ½-maximal K secretion in the distal rat nephron UOsm &gt; 300 because vasopressin is required for optimal K secretion Interpretation Summary (Ethier et al., 1990; Velázquez et al., 1993; Choi &amp; Ziyadeh, 2008): on a normal diet, expect: TTKG = 8 – 9 on a high K diet (or in hyperkalaemia), expect: TTKG &gt; 10 on a low K diet (or in hypokalaemia), expect: TTKG &lt; 3 In hyperkalaemia: TTKG &lt; 6 suggests impaired bioactivity of aldosterone in the ASDN TTKG &gt; 6 suggests non-renal cause (e.g. K overload or ICF / ECF shifts) TTKG &lt; 6 may be due to aldosterone deficiency or impaired renal response to aldosterone (e.g. trimethoprim inhibiting ENaC). The TTKG is perhaps most useful when used to distinguish between mineralocorticoid deficiency and mineralocorticoid resistance by looking for a change in TTKG after administering exogenous mineralocorticoid for a few days (Choi &amp; Ziyadeh, 2008).

Post-hypercapnic alkalosis occurs if chronic hypercapnia suddenly corrected (e.g. by mechanical ventilation). The milk-alkali syndrome is the triad of hypercalcaemia, metabolic alkalosis and ingestion of large quantities of calcium with alkali; hypercalcaemia increases renal bicarbonate reabsorption (exacerbating alkalosis). 6.3.2 Chloride UCl NR = 100 – 250 mmol / 24 hrs In chloride-responsive alkalosis, UCl &lt; 10 mM: vomiting villous adenoma congenital chloride diarrhoea recent diuretics (pause on clinic day in surruptitious use) In chloride-resistant alkalosis UCl &gt; 10 – 30 mM (and also if chloride loss is due to diuretics / tubulopathies). UCl is persistently low after vomiting and is therefore a useful test for surreptitious vomiting. 6.3.2.1 Chloride-depletion alkalosis In chloride depletion, reduced ECF volume leads to reduced GFR (less filtered NaHCO3) and increased Na reabsorption. Thus NaHCO3 reabsorption is increased. Increased distal Na reabsorption leads to increased acid excretion. Therefore, after vomiting, an acid urine is produced (paradoxically) in the face of a metabolic alkalosis. Treatment is volume expansion with NaCl and correction of hypoK. 6.4 Metabolic acidosis 6.4.1 Anion &amp; osmolar gaps Metabolic acidoses are classified as wide-anion-gap (WGMA) or normal-anion-gap (= hyperchloraemic, HCMA). In WGMA, the acidosis is caused by an exogenous acid present in plasma. This is not measured directly, but will manifest as an apparent “anion gap”. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{anion gap, } AG=P_{Na}-P_{HCO_{3}}-P_{Cl} \\tag{6.3} \\end{equation}\\] NB some people also include PK in the calculation. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{corrected anion gap, } cAG=AG+\\frac{40-P_{albumin}}{4} \\tag{6.4} \\end{equation}\\] NB ADD ON to correct for hypoalbuminaemia. A normal AG is 12 ± 2 (or 16 ± 2 if include K+ in the calculation). ‘Deltas’ are calculated by comparing to expected normal values (for AG or HCO3). \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{delta anion gap, } \\Delta AG=AG-12 \\tag{6.5} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{delta bicarbonate, } \\Delta HCO_{3}=25-P_{HCO{3}} \\tag{6.6} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{delta ratio, } =\\frac{\\Delta AG}{\\Delta HCO_{3}} \\tag{6.7} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{delta delta, } \\Delta \\Delta = \\Delta AG - \\Delta HCO_{3} \\text{ (in ketoacidosis)}\\\\ \\text{delta delta, } \\Delta \\Delta = (0.6 \\times \\Delta AG) - \\Delta HCO_{3} \\text{ (in lactic acidosis)}\\\\ \\tag{6.8} \\end{equation}\\] The correction factor (0.6) applied when computing the delta in lactic acidosis is thought to be due to lower renal clearance of lactate (compared to ketone) anions (Berend et al., 2014). Normal range for delta ratio (ΔAG / ΔHCO3) is 1 – 2. Therefore to interpret delta ratios: Osmolar gaps are used to identify exogenous or un-measured osmoles in the plasma (which may be present in a subset of WGMA in which the acid is osmotically active): \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{calculated osmolality, } cP_{Osm} =(2\\times P_{Na})+P_{urea}+P_{glucose} \\tag{6.9} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{osmolar gap, } OG = \\text{measured } P_{Osm} - cP_{Osm} \\tag{6.10} \\end{equation}\\] Historically, it has been technically difficult to measure urinary ammonium. Therefore the urinary anion gap has been used as a proxy measure - either in isolation or in combination with the urinary osmolar gap (Kraut &amp; Madias, 2012; Sharma et al., 2015): \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{urinary anion gap, } UAG=U_{Na}+U_{K}-U_{Cl} \\tag{6.11} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{calculated urinary osmolality, } cU_{Osm} = 2 \\times (U_{Na}+U_{K})+U_{urea}+U_{glucose} \\tag{6.12} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{urinary osmolar gap, } UOG=\\text{measured } U_{Osm} - cU_{Osm} \\tag{6.13} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{urinary cations, } U_{cations}=\\frac{U_{Osm}-U_{urea}-U_{glucose}}{2} \\tag{6.14} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{calculated urinary ammonium, } cU_{NH_{4}}\\approx UAG \\approx \\frac{UOG}{2} \\approx U_{cations}-(U_{Na}+U_{K}) \\tag{6.15} \\end{equation}\\] UAG normal range is positive 30 – 50. 6.4.2 Causes of a metabolic acidosis 6.4.2.1 Approach to metabolic acidosis Order of investigations in metabolic acidosis: cAG – is this a normal or wide gap acidosis? ΔAG vs ΔHCO3 in WGMA – is rise in AG proportional to fall in HCO3 (or is this a mixed metabolic disorder)? PaCO2 – is the fall in PaCO2 proportional to the fall in HCO3 (0.16 kPa per mM)? +/- OG for a WGMA +/- UAG for HCMA +/- FEHCO3 for HCMA with –ve UAG ΔAG / ΔHCO3 &lt; 1 mixed WGMA / HCMA or urinary ketone losses (DKA) ΔAG / ΔHCO3 &gt; 2 mixed WGMA and metabolic alkalosis 6.4.2.2 WGMA Differential diagnosis of a wide-gap metabolic acidosis: G glycols ethylene glycol; propylene glycol * O oxoproline L L-lactate shock, liver disease, metformin, linezolid (several weeks into Rx) D D-lactate short bowel syndromes M methanol * A aspirin R renal failure K ketoacidosis *(?) Propylene glycol (a solvent for parenteral medications: lorazepam, diazepam, phenobarbital) is metabolised to L- and D-lactate. * WGMA with elevated OG = EtOH ketoacidosis, MeOH and the glycols. The OG is NOT elevated with salicylates. There is a time-dependant conversion from OG to AG following ingestion of toxic alcohol (metabolites are charged and bind to Na). 6.4.2.3 HCMA (normal gap) The approach to HCMA has been extensively reviewed [Rodríguez Soriano (2002); Kraut &amp; Madias (2012); Haque et al. (2012); Sharma et al. (2015)). The causes can be classified using the urinary anion gap (6.11) and the fractional excretion of bicarbonate (6.16): POS U AG (UNABLE TO ACIDIFY URINE) RTA RTA type I (always) RTA type IV (always) RTA type II (sometimes) * NEG U AG (ABLE TO ACIDIFY URINE) renal (FEHCO3 &gt; 10 – 15 %) RTA type II (sometimes) * RTA of renal insufficiency (GFR &gt; 15) extrarenal (FEHCO3 &lt;&lt; 5 % **) diarrhoea (GI HCO3 loss) ureteric diversion pancreatic secretions biliary secretions * The UAG is positive in all distal RTA.

This may be particularly pronounced when IV NaCl is used to replace losses of urinary anions that represent a store of “potential bicarbonate” - e.g. ketone bodies or D-lactate (Sabatini &amp; Kurtzman, 2009). Historically, TPN was a cause of “hyperalimentation acidosis” (as cationic amino acids were metabolised to sulphuric acid) - but contemporary formulations contain a source of potential bicarbonate (e.g. acetate) to offset this. 6.4.3 Cautions in the interpretation of UAG extreme volume depletion results in low UNa and UCl low UCl limits NH4 excretion and may therefore lead to a “spurious” positive UAG in diarrhoea ketoacidosis unmeasured anions in the urine (β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetone) may therefore lead to a positive UAG even though urinary NH4+ excretion is increased... …detect this by measuring the urinary osmolar gap glue-sniffing (toluene) - unmeasured anions in the urine (hippurate) A +ve UAG in the context of alkaline urine could signify bicarbonaturia (post-vomiting, loop diuretics, post-hypercapnoea). 6.5 Renal tubular acidosis Free [H+] is nM, but we need to excrete mmoles (1 mmol / kg on Western diet), therefore must be buffered by NH4, PO4… 6.5.1 Classification of RTA type II (pRTA) impaired reabsorption of HCO3 type I (dRTA) inability to secrete acid complete dRTA systemic acidosis (impaired ammoniagenesis) partial dRTA no acidosis (preserved ammoniagenesis) type IV impaired ammoniagenesis (due to hyperK); deficient aldosterone or CD abnormality type III (mixed) CA inhibition RTA in CKD HCMA when GFR &lt; 30; WGMA when GFR &lt; 15 6.5.2 Associations dRTA CaP stones (alkaline urine, hypocitraturia) nephrocalcinosis (in inherited but NOT acquired forms) osteoporosis 6.5.3 Investigation of suspected RTA UAG &amp; FENaHCO3 urine pH (never &lt; 5.5 in dRTA) in suspected pRTA tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP = 100 - FEPO4) &lt; 85 % glycosuria, aminoaciduria, LMW proteinuria in suspected dRTA furosemide-fludrocortisone (FF) test (failure to achieve pH &lt; 5.3 , 3 – 4 hrs after 40 – 80 mg / 1 mg) UCa &gt; 4 mg / kg / day (or spot UCa/Cr &gt; 0.2) in type I RTA USS / KUB (medullary nephrocalcinosis in type I RTA) urinary citrate (low in type I RTA; high in type II / IV RTA) 6.5.4 Causes PRTA (ISOLATED) inherited inherited acquired topiramate PRTA (WITH FANCONI) inherited NBCe1A (AR with ocular abnormalities) metabolic Wilson’s cystinosis fructose intolerance Dent disease mitochondrial cytopathies dysproteinaemia myeloma LCDD LCFS is κ in 96 %, amyloid TIN Sjogren’s other TIN allograft rejection drugs (Abx / cART) tenofovir lamivudine aminoglycosides outdated tetracyclines drugs (other) cisplatin valproate lenalinomide toxins Pb Hg Cd aristolochic acid DRTA inherited AEI (AR) H-ATPase B1 (AR with SNHL) H-ATPase A4 (AR) TIN chronic pyelonephritis chronic TIN obstructive uropathy sickle cell allograft rejection autoimmune hypergammaglobulinaemia SLE Sjogren’s chronic active hepatitis PBC drugs Li+ amphoterocin toluene nephrocalcinosis hyperPTH idiopathic hypercalciuria MSK TYPE IV low renin DM NSAIDs CNIs β– high renin Addison’s CAH ACEi / ARB heparin ketoconazole abnormal CD TIN sprionolactone / amiloride trimethoprim TYPE III inherited CAII (AR with osteopetrosis / cerebral calcification) acquired topiramate (CA inhibition) Sjogrens classically causes a dRTA (but can also cause pRTA if interstitial nephritis).

"],["phosphate.html", "Chapter 7 Phosphate 7.1 Measuring urinary phosphate and calculating TmP/GFR 7.2 Causes of hypophosphataemia", " Chapter 7 Phosphate The usual reason to measure urinary phosphate excretion is to distinguish renal from extra-renal phosphate wasting in chronic hypophosphataemia. Renal phosphate wasting may occur in isolation or as part of a Fanconi syndrome (Imel &amp; Econs, 2012). 7.1 Measuring urinary phosphate and calculating TmP/GFR A fasted, morning sample is preferred to minimise the effects of circadian and post-prandial changes in phosphate and creatinine (Imel &amp; Econs, 2012). Spot urine sample to measure phosphate excretion: fast overnight; discard the first urine void of the day collect second voided urine of the day and a paired blood sample send blood for U&amp;Es, phosphate (and often also HCO3, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, PTH, vitamin D…) send urine for UCr and UPO4 (and often also calcium) interpret results by calculating TRP or TmP/GFR \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{fractional excretion of phosphate, }FE_{PO_{4}} = \\frac{U_{PO_{4}}}{P_{PO_{4}}} \\times \\frac{P_{Creat}}{U_{Creat}} \\tag{7.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{tubular re-absorption of phosphate, }TRP = 1 - FE_{PO_{4}} \\tag{7.2} \\end{equation}\\] It may be preferable to express results in terms of the maximum reabsorption rate of phosphate, TmP. Because net phosphate transport will be largely determined by filtered load, this is usually expressed per unit volume of glomerular filtrate: as TmP/GFR. TmP is a rate of transport (mg per min); GFR is a rate of flow (ml per min); therefore TmP/GFR is a concentration (mg/ml or mM). This concentration is the PPO4 threshold above which phosphate will appear in the urine (Bijvoet et al., 1969). This measure is conceptually complex, but offers a number of potential advantages: it represents a relevant physiological paramater (the capacity of the renal tubule to re-absorb phosphate) there are well-defined, age-specific reference ranges (see below) Strictly speaking, TmP/GFR can only be determined by subjecting individuals to continuous intravenous phosphate infusions. However, it can be estimated from the TRP using one of two methods. The first is to consult a Walton-Bijvoet nomogram (Imel &amp; Econs, 2012). The second is to use an equation derived by Kenny &amp; Glen (Payne, 1998): If TRP \\(\\leq\\) 0.86 then values lie on linear portion of curve and… \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{TmP/GFR} = TRP \\times P_{PO_{4}} \\tag{7.3} \\end{equation}\\] If TRP &gt; 0.86 then values lie on splay and… \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{TmP/GFR} = \\alpha \\times P_{PO_{4}} \\tag{7.4} \\end{equation}\\] …where, \\[\\begin{equation} \\alpha = \\frac{0.3 \\times TRP}{1 - (0.8 \\times TRP)} \\tag{7.5} \\end{equation}\\] There is some evidence that using the equation is less likely result in errors (Barth et al., 2000). 7.1.1 Reference ranges As a general rule, TRP &lt; 0.8 is abnormal (or &lt; 0.9 if PPO4 &lt; 0.8 mM). Age-specific reference ranges for TmP/GFR have been reported (Payne, 1998). These are approximately the same as reference ranges for PPO4. 7.2 Causes of hypophosphataemia The differential diagnosis and diagnostic approach is reviewed by Imel &amp; Econs (2012). Broadly, hypophosphataemia may be due to: TRANSCELLULAR SHIFTS (TMP/GFR NOT LOW) respiratory respiratory alkalosis metabolic re-feeding syndrome IMPAIRED GI ABSORPTION (TMP/GFR NOT LOW) vit D-indep poor dietary intake malabsorption (including in EtOH XS) phosphate binders (including antacids) vit D-dep vitamin D deficient / impaired signalling RENAL LOSSES (TMP/GFR LOW) FGF23-dep inherited (e.g. XLH, fibrous dysplasia…) acquired (e.g. tumour-associated osteomalacia, post-renal transplant…) FGF23-indep without Fanconi (hyperPTH, diuretics, HHRH) with Fanconi syndrome (inherited or acquired) "],["calcium.html", "Chapter 8 Calcium 8.1 Investigations in hypercalcaemia: 8.2 Urine calcium 8.3 Interpreting the results", " Chapter 8 Calcium Serum calcium is regulated by PTH and vitamin D: Hypercalcaemia can be classified as PTH-dependent or PTH-independent: Drug causes of hypercalcaemia: Mechanism Drugs Impaired urinary Ca2+ excretion thiazide diuretics calcium-containing antacid preps (milk-alkali) lithium Increased absorption vitamin D preparations calcium-containing antacid preps (milk-alkali) Stimulation of PTH secretion lithium Reduced bone buffering vitamin A anti-oestrogens 8.1 Investigations in hypercalcaemia: 8.2 Urine calcium Urine calcium excretion will vary according to calcium intake and urinary sodium excretion (with UCa and UNa changing in parallel) (Foley &amp; Boccuzzi, 2010).

Results may be expressed either as: total calcium excretion (as mg per kg BW per day) 24hr calcium-creatinine clearance ratio, CCCR calcium / creatinine excretion ratio (as mg/mg or mmol/mmol) (The CCCR is often referred to as the FECa, but given the extent to which serum calcium is protein-bound, it may not be appropriate to think of it as such.)

This equation is reproduced here: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{urine volume, } V = \\frac{OL}{U_{Osm}} \\end{equation}\\] We stated that this simple relationship can be used to explore a number of phenomena, such as: explaining why drinking seawater causes dehydration explaining why giving 0.9% NaCl can exacerbate hyponatraemia in some circumstances calculating the water intake that would cause hyponatraemia explaining why poor diet (low dietary solute intake) can cause hyponatraemia In this appendix, we consider these scenarios in more detail. B.1 Why drinking seawater causes dehydration The osmolality of seawater is ~1000 mOsm/kg. Imagine 1L of seawater is ingested by somebody whose kidneys are only able to concentrate urine to a maximum of 900 mOsm/kg. The osmolar load (1000 mOsm) must then be excreted in a minimum of 1.11L of urine (=1000/900), leading to a net loss of 0.11L of free water from the body. B.2 Why giving 0.9% NaCl can exacerbate hyponatraemia in some circumstances Hyponatraemia may occur in the context of unregualted ADH release. In this context, urine osmolality is fixed so as to generate a concentrated urine. Suppose hyponatraemia develops in a person in whom ADH activation sets UOsm at 600 mOsm/kg. If we were to administer 1L of intravenous 0.9% NaCl (=150 mM), this would deliver an osmolar load of 300 mOsm. This load would be excreted in 0.5L of urine, leaving 0.5L of free water in the body to exacerbate the hyponatraemia. For this reason, hypertonic saline may be required in the treatment of severe or symptomatic hyponatraemia. B.3 Calculating the water intake required to cause hyponatraemia Hyponatraemia is a problem of excess body water. In normal circumstances (with completely normal renal function and an intact ADH axis), the kidney is able to respond to water challange by producing a dilute urine. The minimum possible urine osmolality will be ~50 mOsm/kg. A typical daily osmolar load is around 10 mOsm per kg body weight (for somebody taking a Western diet); therefore ~700 mOsm in a 70 kg person. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{daily osmole excretion } = 10 \\text{mOsm per kg body weight} \\tag{B.1} \\end{equation}\\] This load can be accompanied by a free water intake of anything up to 14L per day (700/50), and that water can still be excreted in a urine that might be as dilute as 50 mOsm/kg. However, any water intake exceeding this threshold cannot be excreted and would be retained as free water, resulting in hyponatraemia. Therefore it should be apparent that in normal circumstances, the volume of water required to generated hyponatraemia through polydipsia is remarkably high (~14L per day). However, in many patients who are unwell and may have low dietary solute intake and / or some limit to renal water excretion (e.g. mild CKD) then drinking a relatively low volume of water might result in hyponatraemia. If daily solute intake = 350 mOsm and UOsm cannot be lowered beyond 100 mOsm/kg then water intake in excess of 3.5L per day (350/100) would cause hyponatraemia. B.4 Why poor diet (low dietary solute intake) can cause hyponatraemia When dietary solute intake is low, the volume of urine used to excrete that osmolar load will also be low (for any given UOsm). This may limit water excretion, resulting in hyponatraemia. A diet that is relatively rich in carbohydrate will be low in solutes: carbohydrate is metabolised to CO2 and H2O, whereas protein is metabolised to urea (Thaler et al., 1998; Anon, n.d.). Thus hyponatraemia arising from this mechanism is commonly encountered in beer potomania and in patients on a “tea and toast diet”.
