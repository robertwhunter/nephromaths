# Appendix 3 - what's the mechanism?

## Mechanisms in dRTA (see [ESPN clinical practice points, NDT 2021](https://doi: 10.1093/ndt/gfab171)):  

Mechanism of **hypoK in dRTA**:  

i) response to systemic acidosis (inhibits PCT Na reabsorption and therefore stimulates RAAS)  
ii) increased voltage gradient in CD (Na reabsorption not balanced by H excretion)  
iii) sometimes also drug-induced direct causes (e.g. amphoterocin)

Mechanism of **hypoK in pRTA**:  

i) increased HCO3 delivery and flow rate in distal nephron (Unwin 2001)

<br>
<br>

Mechanism of **hypercalciuria in dRTA**:

i) release of Ca from bone (as protons are buffered by apatite)  
ii) tubular resistance to the anti-calicuric effects of PTH

<br>

Mechanisms of **stones / nephrocalcinosis in dRTA**:  

i) hypercalciuria  
ii) hypocituria (enhanced reabsorption of citrate in PCT; citrate inhibits stone formation)
